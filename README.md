# messages-logging-to-console
Users should see a message log to the console indicating whether the shelter dog or cat is available.


## Expected Behavior

When a name is stored in the `chosenPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating whether the pet is available and whether it is a dog or a cat. If the pet is not available, a message should indicate that and suggest the shelter's featured cat and dog. No errors should be returned.
